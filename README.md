# League-of-legends
Excel And Power BI Project (Fun And learning Project)


Not only was this project a great way to exercise my skills, but it also provided me with a deeper understanding of the game I used to play.

Here are the steps I followed to complete the project:

1- I gathered data from an external source in Excel format.


2- Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned and explored the data to get a better understanding of its structure and contents.

3- I then used the Power Query tool to prepare the data for analysis, including transforming and shaping the data as needed.

4- To enhance the visual appeal of the data, I added relevant images to make it more engaging and easier to understand.

5- Using DAX, I created relevant measures to help analyze and interpret the data effectively.

6- Finally, I developed an interactive BI dashboard/report that provides a comprehensive view of the data and allows users to explore it in a dynamic and user-friendly way.
